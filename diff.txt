+feat: Initial setup for MongoDB database and server
+
+This commit sets up the initial structure for a MongoDB database connection and a basic server. It includes:
+
+- Creation of an `.env` file for storing environment variables.
+- Implementation of a `conn.js` file to handle the database connection.
+- Definition of `schoolModel.js` and `studentModel.js` to define the database schemas for schools and students.
+- Creation of the `ronaldo_school_app.js` server, which handles basic routing and a webhook endpoint.
+- Development of the `student_app.js` server to handle student-related operations.
+
